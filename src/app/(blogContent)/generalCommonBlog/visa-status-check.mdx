It can be stressful to apply for a visa, but it doesn't have to be stressful to check on the progress of your application. Finding out how to check on the status of your visa application can give you peace of mind and help you make better travel plans, whether you're going on vacation, a work trip, or to move abroad.

## Understanding The Visa Application Process

When you send in your visa application, it starts a process with several important steps, each of which shows a different part of the evaluation process. Here are some more specifics about what happens at each stage:

### Received:

This is the first step in the process. The status of "Received" means that the visa processing centre has gotten your application and nothing important is missing. Now, your application is in queue for the first review, where the basic check of the papers you sent in makes sure everything is in order.

### Under Processing:

Your application is looked over in more depth during this phase. Immigration officials look at the papers you've given them, like proof of your income, job, the reason for your visit, and any other paperwork needed for your specific <LinkText href="/blog/types-of-visas/" text="visa category"/> . Background checks, which include looking at your security and criminal record, are also done to make sure that there are no legal issues that could stop you from getting a visa.

### Issued:

This is the state that all applicants want to see. The word "Issued" means that your entry was accepted. The visa has been printed and is ready to be attached to your passport, or it will be given to you when you arrive, based on how the country gives visas. All checks and reviews have been completed
satisfactorily. You can now move forward with your trip plans.

### Rejected:

This is the worst state possible: "rejected." This means that your visa application did not go through. A visa rejection can happen for many reasons, such as not showing enough ties to your home country, not showing enough proof of financial stability, giving incomplete or wrong information, or security checks that raise concerns. Most of the time, the letter of rejection will explain exactly why you were turned down. This can help you decide if you can fix the problem and apply again. You usually have the option to review the decision or give more information that could change the decision.

Knowing about these steps can help you see how far along your visa application is and give you an idea of what to expect next in the process.
