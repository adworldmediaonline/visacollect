## Cheaper Countries to Live In

Based on recommendations from thoughtful travellers like YOU, here are ten of the most affordable nations to call home this year.

### 1. Vietnam

Vietnam is the ultimate budget travel destination for anyone wishing to live and work in an exotic location but cannot afford a fortune. For expats, it is among the greatest and least expensive nations to call home. Vietnam offers enough to see and do even if it is still somewhat of an insider tip regarding less expensive places to live in. Vietnam is a relatively adventure travel location, has great scenery to discover, and offers mouthwatering native cuisine for foodies.

Ho Chi Minh City in the south, capital Hanoi in the north, and Da Nang in the national centre comprise the major cities. These cities will house most employment opportunities.

**Popular Jobs here:** Teaching English is the most often sought-after employment for foreigners in Vietnam. With average monthly pay ranging from $1,101 to $1,700 USD, which exceeds in several surrounding nations, English teachers have multiple opportunities.

**Cost of living:** The city or area you decide to visit determines, like in most nations, Vietnam's cost of living. Of sure, cities like Ho Chi Minh and Hanoi are more costly than rural areas; but, the pay is also higher. If you stick to local restaurants or street cuisine, eating out costs roughly $1–3 per meal; a small flat may be rented for about $250 a month; Western-style restaurants are roughly $10. With local public transport beginning at about $0.30 and taxis from just $0.50 per km, transportation is rather reasonably priced.

And since Costa Rica is one of the less expensive nations Americans may reside in, you won't have to go broke living and working there. Additionally readily available are bargain flights from the US, which makes a trip to Costa Rica much more appealing. Costa Rica is more costly than other nations in the region, including Guatemala or Nicaragua, but the distinction is that incomes also often are higher.
