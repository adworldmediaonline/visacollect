## FAQs

### 1. How do I get my passport to last longer while I'm abroad?

Most countries don't let you extend the length of time a passport is good. To get a new passport, you would need to go to the office or consulate of your country that is closest to you.

### 2. During my trip, what should I do if I lose or have my passport stolen?

Tell the cops right away about the loss or theft, and then call the embassy or consulate of your country that is closest to you. They can help you get a temporary passport or an emergency travel paper so you can continue your trip or go back home.

### 3. Is there a way to quickly update my passport if I'm going on a trip abroad soon?

For an extra fee, many countries offer faster passport services. Check with the passport office in your country to see if they can speed up the renewing process so you can leave on time.

### 4. I have two passports from different countries. Can I still travel?

If you are a citizen of two countries, you can travel with two IDs. It is important to use the same passport to enter and leave a country. If you are a member of a certain country, you may need to use the passport of that country to enter and leave.

### 5. What is the best way to move visas and legal travel stamps from an old passport to a new one?

Visas and stamps can't be moved from one passport to another. When you go on a trip, you should bring both your old passport with you along with your new passport. But check with the office that gave you the visa to see if you need a new one.

### 6. Have a full passport that doesn't have any room for new stamps or cards. What does that mean?

If the pages in your passport run out, you will have to get a new one, even if it hasn't ended yet. Some countries won't let you in if there isn't enough room for a new stamp.

### 7. How can I keep my passport from getting damaged while I'm travelling for a long time?

Protect your passport with a protective cover and don't fold it or write on it. Always keep it somewhere safe and dry.

### 8. Can I get a digital passport? Are they accepted for foreign travel?

In many countries, you can get a digital passport, also called an e-passport, that has a biometric number on it. You should still bring your real passport with you, though, because digital copies on your phone or other device are not always accepted for travel.

### 9. What are the rules for taking pictures for my passport? Can I wear glasses or a hat?

Each country has its own rules about what kind of picture is needed for a passport, but in general, you need a clear, front-facing photo with a plain background. If you want to avoid light, take off your glasses. Headwear is only allowed for religious reasons and shouldn't cover your face.

### 10. How often do the rules about passports change, and how can I keep up?

Rules about how long a passport is valid can change depending on security and political issues. Check your government's travel warnings or use a service like VisaCollect to get up-to-date information on what documents you need for travel.
