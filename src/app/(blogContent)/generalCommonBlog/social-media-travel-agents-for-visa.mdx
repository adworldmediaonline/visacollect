## Best Free Social Media Management Tools for Travel and VISA Agents

Managing multiple social media accounts can be challenging. Fortunately, there are several free tools available that can help streamline this process.

**1.HootSuite:**

This all-in-one social media management platform allows you to manage your social media across various platforms, schedule posts, and use other advanced features.

Hootsuite lets you manage all of your social media accounts in one place. Instead of individually logging into your Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram accounts, you can link your accounts to Hootsuite. From there, you can manage all of your posts, comments, and replies on all platforms directly from the Hootsuite dashboard. You can also use Hootsuite to schedule posts on those platforms ahead of time.

For example:

If you are going on a trip for four days and want to keep posting new content on your social media during that time, but you don’t want to be posting while on vacation, you can use Hootsuite to select the date and time that each post gets published.

Basically, you enjoy your trip, and your social media pages stay updated at the same time.

Total win-win! :)

**2. SurveyMonkey:**

This tool allows you to get customer reviews and feedback quickly. You can send surveys directly to customers after their trips or share them on social media.

SurveyMonkey is an easy, free way to create surveys and send them out to your clients. As a travel and VISA agent or e VISA advisor, you can use SurveyMonkey to create and send a survey to clients after their trips to gauge their satisfaction.

Additionally, you can use SurveyMonkey to get general feedback from your clients about your trip and activity selection, as well as learn about services they’d like to see you offer. Maybe you usually offer vacation packages, but some of your clients would secretly be interested in more standalone activities.

So, by creating free surveys with SurveyMonkey and sending them out, you can find out!

**3.Canva:**

Canva is an online tool that allows you to create beautiful social images. With just a few clicks, you can add filters, text, change colors, and make other basic edits to your images.

You know those adorable colorful infographics you see on your friends’ Instagram accounts that you’re always posting to your story? They were probably made on Canva! Canva is an easy way to design graphics, posters, invitations, and basically anything else. We’ve even used it to design resumes before.

Canva provides you with easily customizable templates for your designs, or you can create a design without one. You can use it to create a shareable graphic to share on Instagram and Twitter and advertise your business.

**4.Grammarly:**

You know that one word you always forget how to spell? Okay, maybe there’s like 6 words. Or maybe you have a hard time remembering the difference between “effect” and “affect.”
Whatever it is, Grammarly can help! Whether you’re writing an Instagram caption, a description of a trip on your website, or composing an email to a potential client, you can write your copy in Grammarly first to make sure that everything looks correct.

The app can also help with more than just spelling. Grammarly just launched a brand new feature that can even detect the tone of your copy to make sure you are conveying the right message.

**5.Typito:**

If you have a TikTok or YouTube account that you use for your business, or if you’ve been posting content to Instagram Reels, you should be using Typito. Think Canva, but for video. Typito allows you to write whatever you want and easily drag and drop the text onto the video.

**6.Google Analytics:**

Google Analytics is an amazing free resource for any online business. Once you connect it to your web page, it tells you invaluable data such as which countries you’re getting the most viewers from, how they find your website, and at what time of day you have the most viewers. This information can help you determine who your demographic is and the best place to post advertisements for your e VISA agency – Instagram ads, Google ads, and so on and so forth.

**7.Bitly:**

There are many efficient ways to market your e VISA business through social media. One is by sharing articles about news in the travel industry and VISA business to your Twitter and Facebook so that your accounts stay relevant. Another is by writing and sharing blog posts about the travel industry and the ins and outs of being an e VISA agent. If you do one or both of these things, you should be using Bitly. Bitly turns long URL links into short, share-friendly links you can post on Twitter without going over the character limit.

**8.Buffer:**

Buffer is very similar to Hootsuite. The main difference is that although Hootsuite handles post scheduling as well as comments and replies, Buffer is only for scheduling posts. If you create a lot of content at one time, but want it to be published sporadically, Buffer is the way to go.
