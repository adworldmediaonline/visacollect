### Enjoy the Beauty of Cherry Blossoms

Looking at cherry blossoms, or hanami, is more than just an activity in Japan. It's an experience that captures the fleeting beauty of nature and the spirit of Japanese aesthetics. As the petals of the cherry blossoms open, parks and shrines all over Japan, from Tokyo's busy streets to Kyoto's quiet paths, become places of delicate beauty. When you do hanami, you can really enjoy the beautiful spring scenery, so you have to do it during Golden Week.

### Take part in traditional celebrations.

Traditional festivals are a big part of Golden Week. Each one tells a story about Japan's rich cultural history. Seeing the skill and beauty of geisha performances in Atami's beautiful scenery is a treat that you can only get at the Atami Odori Geisha dance festival. The historical Haru No Fujiwara Matsuri, on the other hand, takes you back in time with its processions and warrior shows. It honours the Fujiwara family's history in Hiraizumi. These gatherings are more than just events; they give you a glimpse into Japan's heart.

### Get in touch with nature

As part of Golden Week Japan, Greenery Day urges people to get back in touch with nature. Japan has a lot of parks and gardens that are nice places to get away from the noise and chaos of the city. Shinjuku Gyoen in Tokyo has large landscapes, and Kairakuen in Mito has been carefully planned and built. Each green area has its own story of peace and conservation. During your Golden Week trips, taking a slow walk or just enjoying the peaceful surroundings can be very relaxing.
