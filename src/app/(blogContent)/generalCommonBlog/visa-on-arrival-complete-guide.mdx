## How do I get a Visa on Arrival?

A Visa on Arrival is exactly what it sounds like a visa that travellers can get when they get to their final destination country. They can get them at airports and other foreign entry points. A Visa on Arrival is different from other <LinkText href="/blog/types-of-visas/" text="types of visas"/> because it is given to you after you land, which speeds up the entry process.

## Countries Offering Visas on Arrival

As an incentive for tourists and business travellers, many countries let you get a visa when you arrive. Indonesia, Nepal, Turkey, and Thailand are just a few of the popular places to visit. People who want to travel on the spur of the moment will like these countries because they make getting a visa easy once you get there.
