## How to Preview

### Option 1: Update Main Page (Recommended for final implementation)
Replace the import in `src/app/page.tsx`:
```typescript
// Change from:
import Header from '@/components/main/Header';
import BannerMain from '@/components/main/BannerMain';

// To:
import HeaderTwo from '@/components/main/header-two';
import BannerMainTwo from '@/components/main/banner-main-two';
```

### Option 2: Create New Route (For Testing)
You can access the new design at `/page-two` route by creating the proper file structure.

## Files Created
- `src/components/main/header-two.tsx`
- `src/components/main/banner-main-two.tsx`
